# lambdafunctions
AWS Lambda is a new category of computing where business logic can be directly deployed to a production environment without thinking about servers. Another word for this is serverless or FaaS (Function As A Service). Some of the benefits of AWS Lambda include no servers to manage, continuous scaling, and billing at the sub-second level.
